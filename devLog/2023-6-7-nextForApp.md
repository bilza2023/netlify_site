# THE PROBLEM OF NO-FIXED DATABASE
- so far i have quiz/survey that once has responses can not be changed just copied. But the copy and the one with responses has then no link with each other.

- Solution : Divide the data such that the questions are part of Template and once they are converted to Test then I can only change "Access" and time etc.
- The Tests can be "run" and "stop". every time they are run we can change the time and access and collect new responses.
- Even if we do not change the access ot timings . the same people can re-submitt again. 
- for example we run a test once and out of 6 only 3 people response. once we stop it (or it is stopped at time) the missing people will be marked as missing. if we re-run the same test it can take the remaining people but not the people which has submitted on this run.
-  We can run many copies of a Test with different data (members and timings).
- Every run can not be changed and just be stopped. once a run is stopped it can not be restarted.
