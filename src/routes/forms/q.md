Am creating a web-app (using node.js svelte and mongodb).

The app is test/exam automation. 
Teachers can create quiz tests and then send these tests to their students who will attempt them and submit them,  they are then  automatically checked and result is created.

Requirement : What feature do you think the Minimum Viable Product should have?

User authentication: The app should have a secure login system to ensure that only authorized users (teachers and students) can access the app.

Test creation: Teachers should be able to create and customize quiz tests, add questions with different types of answers (multiple-choice, true/false, short answer, etc.). 

Teacher be able to set a time limit for the test.

Test assignment: Teachers should be able to assign tests to their students and track which students have completed the test.

Test taking: Students should be able to take the assigned tests, view the questions, and submit their answers within the allotted time.

Automatic grading: The app should automatically grade the submitted tests and calculate the scores for each student.

Results display: Teachers should be able to view and download the results of their students' tests, including scores, correct and incorrect answers, and any feedback provided.
