Great now my code is in this shape
function gradeMCQ(answer) {
  let marks = 0;
  if (answer.multiSelect === false) {
    marks = singleSelect(answer);
  } else {
    // call multiSelect function here
    return 0;
  }
  return marks;
}

function singleSelect(answer) {
  if (answer.selectedOptions[0] === answer.correctOptions[0]) {
    return answer.totalMarks;
  } else {
    return 0;
  }
}


Now lets write the function for multiple select == true;

 - to grade multiple select == true we can not compare simply the ids in selected options to the ids in correct options since the students will select all the options and be sure that the selected options will contain all of the correct options.
 Rules:
    - First divide the total marks by the number of correct options. if the total marks are 10 and correct options are 3 each correct option has 3.33 marks (round to 2nd decimal point).
    - Now for every correct option found in selected options award 3.33 marks
    - for every slected option that is NOT found in correct options 3.33 marks be duducted. at the end if the marks are in negative just return 0 rather than the negative number.
